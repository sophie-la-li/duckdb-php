# DuckDB PHP client

---

This package provides a [DuckDB](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb) Client API for PHP.

Focused on performance, it uses the official [C API](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/c/overview.html) internally through [FFI](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ffi.php), achieving good benchmarks.
This library is more than just a wrapper for the C API; it introduces custom, PHP-friendly methods to simplify working with DuckDB. It is compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS, requiring PHP version 8.3 or higher.

[Getting started](getting-started.md) is a great starting point for these docs.
